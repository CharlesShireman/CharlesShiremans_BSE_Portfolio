# LED Matrix Audio Visualizer
I used a 8x32 LED matrix, controlled by an Arduino microcontroller, to graph an FFT from live sound frequencies taken from a microphone. The entire system is powered through an AC power outlet which allows the user to always display sound data without replacing batteries. The system is also speed-oriented and quickly graphs sound data as it happens.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was setting up and controlling my LED matrix with an Arduino microcontroller. Using the Adafruit NeoMatrix library for the Arduino IDE, I was able to control each LED specifically as well as create custom light animations. The LED matrix was wired directly into the Arduino without the use of a breadboard to simplify input. One issue I faced in this project was wiring the screen to the Arduino. I went through multiple iterations of wiring but eventually figured out the only the screen input connections were needed while the rest can be ignored.

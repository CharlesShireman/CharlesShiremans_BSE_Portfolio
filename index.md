# LED Matrix Audio Visualizer
I used a 8x32 LED matrix, controlled by an Arduino microcontroller, to graph an FFT from live sound frequencies taken from a microphone. The entire system is powered through an AC power outlet which allows the user to always display sound data without replacing batteries. The system is also speed-oriented and quickly graphs sound data as it happens.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was setting up and controlling my LED matrix with an Arduino microcontroller. Using the Adafruit NeoMatrix library for the Arduino IDE, I was able to control each LED specifically as well as create custom light animations. The LED matrix was wired directly into the Arduino without the use of a breadboard to simplify input. One issue I faced in this project was wiring the screen to the Arduino. I went through multiple iterations of wiring but eventually figured out the only the screen input connections were needed while the rest can be ignored.
